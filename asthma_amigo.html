                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p> 
                        In the context of Australia, children under the age of 15 is an important demographic
                        when it comes to suffering from asthma. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare -  
                        <i>"In the first three years of life, 16.9% of Australian infants experience asthma or wheezing. 
                        Among non- asthmatic children between the ages of 4 to 5 years, 4.1% have shown to develop asthma by 
                        the seventh year of life."</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Asthma Amigo</b> is an iOS application that caters to the parents of the aforementioned 
                        demographic. The application lets parents track their kid's asthma via journaling (recording asthmatic events). 
                        A given journal entry intuitively packs together data related to the event such as location, temperature, air quality,
                        asthma trigger etc. These entries can then be used for reference and to predict the possibility of similar conditions 
                        occuring in the future.

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>Asthma Amigo was developed by a team of 5 students as part of their final year Capstone
                        project. It was developed in three agile sprints while adhering to agile practices. 
                        I was responsible for:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developing a system for sending timely notifications based on a multitude of factors and user preferences.</li>
                            <li>Developing a digital version of the asthma action plan prescribed by doctors.</li>
                            <li>Developing the back-end system that persisted asthma attack records, medicine information and user preferences with Core Data and PLists.</li>
                            <li>Integrating APIs such as Google Places, Dark Sky and Air Quality APIs with the app. Used Alamofire and SwiftyJSON for fetch requests.</li>
                            <li>Ensuring quality of application by performing Usability Testing on potential users.</li>
                        </ul>
