                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Living in a shared-house setting involves 
                        dividing house chores amongst the residents, and this includes emptying rubbish 
                        bins located inside the house and taking the outside bins to the curb before 
                        garbage pickup day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For most houses, the landlord often sanctions a roster that assigns a 
                        given room of the house each week for bin-duty. However, this roster is 
                        never strictly followed, not because the residents are lazy or occupied,
                         but simply because they forget their turn, and there is no mechanism to 
                         remind them effectively on the fly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The repercussions of leaving bins full to the brim may often times be 
                        severe as rubbish and waste from the kitchen remaining unattended for 
                        long periods of time is extremely unhygienic and can spew bad odour and 
                        diseases. Basically, a physical roster is not very efficient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All in all, <b>we are now-a-days more accustomed to acknowledging a notification on our dedicated device as opposed to a roster taped on the wall</b>, 
                        and our solution to the bin day problem revolves around this.

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p><b>Empty Me</b> is an iOT based solution that assists better waste management 
                        for shared houses and student accommodations. It comprises of two parts - 
                        an iOS app that allows landlords to add houses, tenants and also to create a 
                        bin-duty roster; an internet connected rubbish bin that alerts tenants to 
                        throw rubbish away when bin is full via the app.</p>

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>Empty Me was developed by a team of 2 students as part of their Advanced Mobile Development
                        Unit at Monash University. 
                        I was responsible for:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developing the backend for storing tenant and house details using Firebase.</li>
                            <li>Developing a log-in system in iOS with Firebase with two different portals for landlord and tenant.</li>
                            <li>Implementing sensor circuit with Raspberry Pi and Johnny-Five (JavaScript) scripting that detects rubbish levels and uploads it online in real time.</li>
                        </ul>
