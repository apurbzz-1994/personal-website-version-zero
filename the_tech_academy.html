                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>In essence, <a href = "https://thetechacademy.net/" class="a-page"><b>The Tech Acacemy (TTA)</b></a> is a social enterprise in Bangladesh that focuses on teaching children Electronics, Computer Programming and other 
                        STEM related topics. TTA is the one of the first start-ups to have ever executed something like this for children in Bangladesh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other than teaching, TTA also maintained a <b>Research & Development Lab</b> where TTA students
                        and staff collaborated on creative projects (installations, interactive systems, games etc).
                        These were a mix of client-based and experimental projects. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was involved with TTA from <b>January 2017 - May 2017</b>.

                <h5><b>Motion Sensing Camera for wildlife photography</b></h5>
                <p> Here, one of the kids (Samir) attempted to design a prototype for a motion-sensing camera 
                    that can be used for wild-life photography. The prototype makes use of an ultrasonic sensor 
                    to detect anything in front of it. Once detected, the sensor triggers 
                    a program written in Processing to snap a frame off the webcam.

                <h5><b>Flappy Eggy</b></h5>
                <p> Flappy eggy is essentially a Flappy Bird clone with a twist - the player has to physically
                    jump on a platform in order to navigate the bird. The "platform" was equipped with piezoelectric
                    sensors and an Arduino read the change in voltage to detect jumps.  
                </p>
                <p>This was a team effort. I was responsible for implementing and calibrating the hardware part. Moreover, 
                    I initiated the development of an Android version of the game minus the sensors.

                <h5><b>Noise Box</b></h5>
                <p>Noise Box makes use of the Minim Library in Processing to alter the 
                    features of a sound, such as pitch and volume. Moreover, these features 
                    can be manipulated by a simple interface I created using a potentiometer, a button
                    and an Arduino.
